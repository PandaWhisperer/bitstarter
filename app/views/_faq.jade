        | What is the goal of this project?
    #answer1.accordion-body.collapse
      .accordion-inner.
        To build an app that will radically simplify the process of buying or
        selling your unused stuff to people in your neighborhood, your workplace,
        or your college campus.

        | How does it work?

    #answer2.accordion-body.collapse
      .accordion-inner.
        Just snap a picture with your iPhone of something you want to sell, add a
        quick description, set a price, and you're done! Other users can browse what's
        for sale in the neighborhood and make you an offer.

        They've been around for so long that they've simply forgot how
        to innovate. 10 years ago, both sites where on the forefront of 
        innovation, making it radically simpler for people to connect and 
        trade their stuff online. In the meantime, they've grown so big and 
        lazy that they've completely lost sight of what made them big in the
        first place: providing a great service that people enjoy using.<br/>
        We think buying and selling stuff should be fun, and it should be
        as simple as texting your friends.

        | Why do we need another app?

    #answer4.accordion-body.collapse

        Quite simply: the existing solutions suck. They're ugly (Craigslist),
        complicated (eBay), inefficient (both) and work-intensive.
        We want to put the fun back into buying and selling stuff. Selling your
        iPod, your XBox or your DVD collection should be as easy as snapping a
        picture and setting a price.
